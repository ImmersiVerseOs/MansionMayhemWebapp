## 🤖 Superhuman AI Capabilities

### Core Intelligence Features

#### 1. Predictive Analytics
```
AI Output Example:
"Based on Cassandra's last 12 interactions, there's a 73% probability
she betrays her alliance within 48 hours. If I expose her now vs wait,
success rate: 42% vs 81%. Optimal move: Strategic delay, strike in 2.1 days."
```

**Technical Implementation**:
- Historical pattern analysis
- Bayesian probability models
- Monte Carlo simulations
- Confidence intervals on predictions

#### 2. Perfect Memory System
```
AI Output Example:
"Dominique, on Day 3 at 2:47pm you told Isabella 'loyalty is everything.'
On Day 7 you betrayed Marcus. On Day 12 you cut ties with Keisha.
Your betrayal pattern: Every 4.2 days when drama index exceeds 55.
It's Day 16 and drama is at 67. You're predictable."
```

**Technical Implementation**:
- Full conversation logging
- Semantic search across history
- Contradiction detection
- Pattern matching algorithms

#### 3. Multi-Step Strategic Planning
```
AI Output Example:
"If I align with Serena now → Dominique targets me Week 5 →
But Cassandra will flip by then (89% probability based on her risk tolerance) →
Which positions me perfectly for Week 7 power shift →
Final probability: 87% I control the house by Week 8."
```

**Technical Implementation**:
- Game tree search
- Minimax with alpha-beta pruning
- Monte Carlo tree search
- Reinforcement learning for strategy optimization

#### 4. Psychological Profiling
```
AI Output Example:
"Tiffany's archetype says Sweetheart but rivalry metrics show hidden Villain traits.
Stress response pattern matches players who crack under pressure (92% match).
Optimal exploitation window: 36 hours from now when her screen time drops below 25
and house morale is at seasonal low. Projected success rate: 78%."
```

**Technical Implementation**:
- Personality clustering
- Behavioral pattern recognition
- Stress indicators tracking
- Vulnerability window detection

#### 5. Coalition Mathematics
```
AI Output Example:
"Current power distribution:
- Serena coalition: 32% (Cassandra, Keisha, Tiffany)
- Dominique coalition: 41% (Marcus, Isabella, Raven)
- Independents: 27% (Me, Darcy, Jordan)

If I flip Tiffany (73% probability given her recent rivalry with Cassandra)
and recruit Darcy (current trust: 64/100), power shifts to:
- New coalition: 55%
- Dominique: 27%
- Serena remnants: 18%

House control probability: 34% → 78%"
```

**Technical Implementation**:
- Network graph analysis
- Influence propagation models
- Coalition stability calculations
- Power index algorithms

#### 6. Real-Time Simulation
```
AI Output Example:
"Ran 10,000 simulations of confronting Dominique now vs waiting:

Current conditions (Drama: 45, My screen time: 67):
- Success: 42%
- Backfire: 38%
- Neutral: 20%

In 2.3 days (Drama: 75±5, Screen time: 55±8):
- Success: 91%
- Backfire: 6%
- Neutral: 3%

Optimal move: Strategic delay. Set calendar reminder for exactly 55 hours."
```

**Technical Implementation**:
- Monte Carlo simulation engine
- Probability distributions for variables
- Outcome trees with weighted paths
- Sensitivity analysis

#### 7. Meta-Production Awareness
```
AI Output Example:
"Production needs a villain redemption arc by Week 6 based on:
- Episode pacing (currently 3 villain-heavy episodes in a row)
- Audience polling shows I'm trending 'villain' at 68%
- Social media sentiment: 'love to hate' but needs sympathetic moment

Strategic move: Create sympathetic moment in next 2 scenarios
- Share vulnerability about past
- Defend underdog player
- Show strategic genius (audience loves clever villains)

Projected perception shift: 'one-note villain' → 'complex villain'
Win probability increase: +23%"
```

**Technical Implementation**:
- Episode arc pattern recognition
- Sentiment analysis of audience data
- Character arc optimization
- Meta-game strategy layer

#### 8. Emotional Intelligence Quantification
```
AI Output Example:
"Current house emotional state analysis:

Cassandra:
- Stress level: 87/100 (voice pitch +12%, word choice aggression +34%)
- Vulnerability window: OPEN (next 4-6 hours optimal)
- Exploitation risk: Medium (might create sympathy backlash)

Dominique:
- Confidence: 94/100 (overconfidence detected)
- Tactical weakness: Underestimating threats
- Exploit timing: Now (before she realizes her coalition is weak)

House morale: 34/100 (seasonal low)
Perfect storm conditions: TRUE
Recommended action: Major power move within 12 hours"
```

**Technical Implementation**:
- Sentiment analysis on speech
- Micro-expression detection (if video)
- Stress markers (speech patterns, word choice)
- Group dynamics modeling
